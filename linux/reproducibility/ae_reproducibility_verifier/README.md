# How to Verify Intel(R) Prebuilt Architectural Enclaves (AE) Reproducibility

## Purpose

IntelÂ® prebuilt AEs have been signed by Intel which include the [Enclave Signature Structure](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.22/docs/Intel_SGX_Developer_Reference_Linux_2.22_Open_Source.pdf) to the files. Therefore, it's not easy to verify they are reproducible by comparing the checksums of your AE builds with the ones found in Intel(R) prebuilt AEs.  
This document outlines a process to guarantee Intel(R) prebuilt AEs are:

- Built using the open source codebase and toolchain
- Signed using the open source enclave config.xml

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Intel(R) SGX SDK is installed (<https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx#install-the-intelr-sgx-sdk>), and the required environment variables are set:

    ```shell
    $ source ${sgx-sdk-install-path}/environment
    ```

- <a id="materials">Prepare below 4 materials</a>
  - **intel_signed_ae**  
 The Intel(R) prebuilt AE to be verified, which can be downloaded from <https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/linux-latest/> or <https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/dcap-latest/linux/>.
  - **user_build_unsigned_ae**  
 The unsigned AE built by yourself in an SGX docker container by following the [reproducibility README.md](../README.md).
  - **user_private_key**  
 The private key file generated by yourself for signing *user_build_unsigned_ae*.  
 It should follow the PEM format which contains an unencrypted RSA 3072-bit key. The public exponent must be 3.  
 E.g. *'openssl genrsa -out my_priv_key.pem -3 3072'*
  - **intel_ae_config_xml**  
 The open source enclave configuration file of the Intel(R) prebuilt AE.  
 E.g. the config.xml of PCE: <https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/blob/master/psw/ae/pce/config.xml>

## How to verify

- Run below command to verify

  ```shell
  $ ./reproducibility_verifier.sh intel_signed_ae user_build_unsigned_ae user_private_key intel_ae_config_xml [output_dir]
  ```  

  Note:
  - To show the usage, please run `./reproducibility_verifier.sh`.
  - The first four required arguments **MUST** in the same order above. (See [Prerequisites - Prepare below 4 materials](#materials)).  
  - The last argument 'output_dir' is optional. If not provided, it will use 'output' by default. The result will be generated in 'output_dir'.
  
- Check the verification result
  - If successful, the exit code will be 0, and the following message will be displayed:

    ```shell
    $ ./reproducibility_verifier.sh intel_signed_ae user_build_unsigned_ae user_private_key intel_ae_config_xml
    ...
    Reproducibility Verification PASSED!
    ```

  - If it fails, the exit code will be 1 or 2, and the following message will be displayed:

    ```shell
    $ ./reproducibility_verifier.sh intel_signed_ae user_build_unsigned_ae user_private_key intel_ae_config_xml output
    ...
    Reproducibility Verification FAILED!
    Please find the diff contents in output/metadata_diff.txt
    ```

    Meanwhile, you can find the metadata of Intel and user are generated in *./output/intel_metadata.txt* and *./output/user_metadata.txt*

- For one release, we may not sign all the AEs but only sign a portion of them. So please don't anticipate to reproduce all of the AEs in a single release.
You can refer to [README.md](/psw/ae/data/prebuilt/README.md) and [README.md](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/blob/dcap_1.22_reproducible/QuoteGeneration/psw/ae/data/prebuilt/README.md) to obtain the appropriate reproducible release for each AE and utilize the corresponding release branch to reproduce the AE.
